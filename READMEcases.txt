9th of November 2022:

Decided to remove various cases from the paper. 
Those with realized start times and historical data. 
The naming in the paper is adapted to that change. The DEMKit simulation input is not. So C5_ and C5_realized_ are the simulations for the newly named Case 2.

Case 0

Case 1 --> removed
Case 2 --> removed
Case 3 --> removed

Case 4 --> renamed Case 1
Case 5 --> renamed Case 2
Case 6 --> renamed Case 3
Case 7 --> renamed Case 4 
Case 8 --> renamed Case 5
