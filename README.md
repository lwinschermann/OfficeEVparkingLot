# OfficeEVparkingLot
Data analysis tool for electric vehicle (EV) charging session data. 

Supports filtering, processing, statistical analysis, generating input for DEMKit software, swiping DEMKit output from an Influx database, and generating results/figures from that. 

Developed for EV charging session data collected at an office building parking lot in Utrecht, the Netherlands. 
Can be applied in a broader context, given that data is supplied in an Excel file with (at least) the proper headers.
